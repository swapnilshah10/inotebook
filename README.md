## Description
Developed a full-stack note-taking web application using React for the frontend, Bootstrap for styling, and Django REST Framework for the backend. iNotebook allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The application also features user authentication and authorization, with secure storage of user information and notes. This project involved using modern web development technologies and tools, including React Hooks, Django ORM, and Git for version control. Through this project, I gained experience in building scalable and responsive web applications.
